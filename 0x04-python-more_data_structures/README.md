##  Requirements

### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The `main.py` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`).
*   All your files must be executable.
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

* **0. Squared simple** - Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix. - `0-square_matrix_simple.py`.
* **1. Search and replace** - Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list. - `1-search_replace.py`.
* **2. Unique addition** - Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer). - `2-uniq_add.py`.
* **3. Present in both** - Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets. - `3-common_elements.py`.
* **4. Only differents** - Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set. - `4-only_diff_elements.py`.
* **5. Number of keys** - Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary. - `5-number_keys.py`.
* **6. Print sorted dictionary** - Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys. - `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`.
* **7. Update dictionary** - Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary. - `7-update_dictionary.py`.
* **8. Simple delete by key** - Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary. - `8-simple_delete.py`.
* **9. Multiply by 2** - Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2. - `9-multiply_by_2.py`.
* **10. Best score** - Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value. - `10-best_score.py`.
* **11. Multiply by using map** - Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops. - `11-multiply_list_map.py`.
* **12. Roman to Integer** - Create a function `def roman_to_int(roman_string):` that converts a [Roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) to an integer. - `12-roman_to_int.py`.
* **13. Weighted average!** - Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple `(<score>, <weight>)`. - `100-weight_average.py`.
* **14. Squared by using map** - Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using `map`. - `101-square_matrix_map.py`.
* **15. Delete by value** - Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary. - `102-complex_delete.py`.
* **16. CPython #1: PyBytesObject** - Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects. - `103-python.c`.
