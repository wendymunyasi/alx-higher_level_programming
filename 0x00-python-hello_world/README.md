##  Requirements

### Python Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using python3 (version 3.8.5).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The `main.py` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
*   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`).
*   All your files must be executable.
*   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Shell Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
*   All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2).
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
*   All your files must be executable.

### C Scripts
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions and you don't have to push to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `lists.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.
